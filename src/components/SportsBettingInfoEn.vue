				</div>
			</div>

			<p>
				You can place lots of different sports bets at Stake.com, including the
				following:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Outright Bets & Futures Bets: This is one of the easiest and most
					common types of bets, where you will place a wager on the outcome of
					an event, whether this is on the individual or team to win a
					tournament or competition. Over/under wins for a season and who will
					win the championship are all examples of long-term bets a punter can
					make to get value on their bet down the line.
				</li>
				<li>
					Moneyline Bets: A simple type of bet, often in the form of a 3-way
					moneyline bet where you bet on one of three outcomes - a win, loss, or
					draw.
				</li>
				<li>
					Handicap Bets & Asian Totals: A popular betting type that involves
					adding or subtracting a value from a team or the event’s final score.
					This is similar to a totals bet, where you predict whether the total
					goals or points scored will be over or under a specific number.
					Bettors can also utilise a spread betting strategy to increase their
					chances of winning.
				</li>
				<li>
					Over/Under Lines & Totals Bets: Over/Under, or totals betting is a bet
					placed on the specific number of points or goals scored. This will
					often be the combined score of both teams playing, where the
					sportsbook set the line, and the bettor can decide how much over/under
					this line the outcome will be.
				</li>
				<li>
					Proposition Bets & Player Props: Prop bets are wagers placed on an
					event that isn't tied to the outcome. This is often conducted in the
					form of player props , which can include things like betting on
					individual stats over/under, man of the match/MVP and other specific
					bets that celebrate an athlete's achievement.
				</li>
				<li>
					First Score/First Goal: Prop bet of the first team or player to score
					(points, goals, touchdowns, etc).
				</li>
				<li>
					Halftime/Interval Adjusted Odds for Live Sports: Adjusted odds based
					on live scores.
				</li>
				<li>
					Correct Score: Predict the exact final score of a match to hit it big.
				</li>
				<li>
					Parlay Bets & Same-game Multi Bets : Parlay (or accumulator) bets are
					super popular with sports bettors, enabling you to combine multiple
					selections into the same betting slip. Bettors can use our 'Bet
					Builder' function to place same game multi bets and place multiple
					selections on the single betting slip.
